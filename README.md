# A51-attack
This is my own implementation of Biham and Dunkelman's single-frame basic lead at A5/1.

To start the attack just execute the compileAttak.bat file present in the compileBat folder.
It compiles all the necessary files and the main attack.c source and returns the output in the "keyRegisterState.txt" file in the textFiles folder.
It was decided to use a bat file for execution in such a way that all the necessary files were updated when the attack was compiled in order to make possible modifications and testing faster and more efficient.
